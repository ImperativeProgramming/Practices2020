Make your questions now so we can proceed with the class

Let's also review the [Instructions for Online Classes](https://github.com/ImperativeProgramming/Practices2020/tree/master/0%20-%20Instructions%20for%20online%20classes)

Be aware that:
- Online tasks cannot be retaken
- If you don't have a setup ready until the class starts, you need to wait the end of the class to ask for help

## Todays class
