# Continuation of Linked Lists


## Exercise

Continuing the previous homework, on today's class we will finish the exercise.

* Create a function *printPerson* that gets a single person as paramenter and prints out its information;
* Create a function *search* that gets a name and the head as parameters, searches the *person* in the list and prints out the information of that given person;
* Add a variable *tail* that stores the last added value (and remember to change the functions to do it);
* Add a pointer *previous* to the Linked list, yup now it is a **double linked list** ;)
* Make a function *swap*, take as many objects as you think are needed (remember you need to update at least 4 elements to swap two elements)
