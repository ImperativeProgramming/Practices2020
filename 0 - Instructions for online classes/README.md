# Guidelines for Online Classes

In order to accomplish the laws we will from now on until further notice take our class using online format.

## Access to Microsoft Teams
 The classes will be available to all students enrolled on the Faculty of Informatics. For this we will use *Microsoft Teams*. if any participant does not have an inf account or is a visitor student (e.g. Erasmus) please contact the instructors and ask for a guest account.

 The group should already show up in your teams by the name Imperative Programming Practices [TUE/FRI]. If not please enter into Microsoft Teams and try to add using the team code bellow.

 **Platform:** https://teams.microsoft.com/

 **Email:** [your student Microsoft account, @student.elte.hu or @inf.elte.hu]

 **Password:** [The same password as in the lab computers]

 - Code for students with classes on Tuesdays: 61lf8ab
 - Code for students with classes on Fridays: t2bhvx3


**Notice** Teams doesn't work fine on Firefox, therefore, avoid using it.  Preferably download the application so if you need to interact with the instructor you can share control of the machine.

## Before the class and etiquette

- Make sure you have a C compiler installed in your computer;
- Mute your mic before starting the class;
- Do not hesitate on asking for help, we will do our best to have always two computers, one streaming the class and one for giving individual help;
- To get help you ping the teacher and wait for when he/she is ready, then you leave the class and join a private call.


## Evaluation

The evaluation method will be kept as agreed on the beginning of the semester until further notice.
The amount of home-works and evaluated tasks (composing 20% of the final grade) will be increased in order to encourage students to practice from home.

## Recording of classes and presence

ELTE University has the right to use the classes image of the class instructors for its teaching purposes. This right is **not** extended to the students, therefore, recording and streaming by other means is prohibited.

Presence will be evaluated by practice and lecture instructors after the emergency state is dismissed, meanwhile, all the classes will have presence recorded using the Canvas online quizzes and Microsoft teams statistics.
